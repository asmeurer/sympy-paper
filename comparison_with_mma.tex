\subsection{Mathematica}

Wolfram Mathematica is a popular proprietary CAS.
It features highly advanced algorithms.
Mathematica has a core implemented in C++~\cite{Wolfram2016}
which interprets its own programming language (know as Wolfram language).

% M-expressions

Analogously to Lisp's S-expressions,
Mathematica uses its own style of M-expressions,
which are arrays of either atoms or other M-expression.
The first element of the expression identifies the type of the expression
and is indexed by zero, whereas the first argument is indexed by one.
Notice that SymPy expression arguments are stored in a Python tuple
(that is, an immutable array),
while the expression type is identified by the type of the object storing the
expression.

% Attributes

Mathematica can associate attributes to its atoms.

% Expression mutability

Unlike SymPy, Mathematica's expressions are mutable,
that is one can change parts of the expression tree without the need of
creating a new object.
The reactivity of Mathematica allows for a lazy updating of any references
to that data structure.

% * comparison with Mathematica: commutativity, associative expressions, one-identity. Advantage of SymPy: multiplicative commutativity defined on symbols.
% Products and commutativity

Products in Mathematica are determined by some builtin node types,
such as \texttt{Times}, \texttt{Dot}, and others.
\texttt{Times} is overloaded by the * operator,
and is always meant to represent a commutative operator.
The other notable product is \texttt{Dot}, overloaded by the . operator.
This product represents matrix multiplication,
it is not commutative.
SymPy uses the same node for both scalar and matrix multiplication,
the only exception being with abstract matrix symbols.
Unlike Mathematica, SymPy determines commutativity with respect to
multiplication from the factor's expression type.
Mathematica puts the \texttt{Orderless} attribute on the expression
type.

% Associative expressions.

Regarding associative expressions,
SymPy handles associativity by making associative expressions inherit the
class \texttt{AssocOp},
while Mathematica specifies the \texttt{Flat}\cite{WolframRefFlat} attribute on the expression type.

% One identity


% Pattern matching

Mathematica relies heavily on pattern matching:
even the so-called equivalent of function declaration is in reality
the definition of a pattern matching generating an expression tree transformation
on input expressions.
%
Mathematica's pattern matching is sensitive to associative\cite{WolframRefFlat}, commutative\cite{WolframRefOrderless},
and one-identity\cite{WolframRefOneIdentity} properties of its expression tree nodes\cite{WolframRefFlatAndOrderlessFunctions}.
%
SymPy has various ways to perform pattern matching.
All of them play a lesser role in the CAS than in Mathematica.
looks less mature than Mathematica's,

%% TODO list:
% * comparison with Mathematica: MatrixExp, product not always commutative, type inheritance (polymorphism) and advantage in unifying the product symbol * for symbols and matrices, pattern matching vs. single dispatch.

% Type inheritance and polymorphism

Unlike SymPy, Mathematica does not support type inheritance or polymorphism\cite{Fateman1992}.
% cite examples of class inheritance in SymPy:
%
SymPy relies heavily on class inheritance, but for the most part,
class inheritance is used to make sure that SymPy objects inherit the proper
methods and implement the basic hashing system.
Associativity of expressions can be achieved by inheriting the class \texttt{AssocOp},
which may appear a more cumbersome operation than Mathematica's attribute setting.
%There are also cases where inheritance is used to extend the mathematical meaning of an expression.

% Matrices

Matrices in SymPy are types on their own.
In Mathematica, nested lists are interpreted as matrices whenever the sublists
have the same length.
The main difference to SymPy is that ordinary operators and functions
do not get generalized the same way as used in traditional mathematics.
Using the standard multiplication in Mathematica performs an elementwise
product, this is compatible with Mathematica's convention of commutativity of
\texttt{Times} nodes.
Matrix product is expressed by the \textit{dot} operator,
or the \texttt{Dot} node.
The same is true for the other operators, and even functions,
most notably calling the exponential function \texttt{Exp} on a matrix
returns an elementwise exponentiation of its elements.
The real matrix exponentiationl is available through the \texttt{MatrixExp}
function.

% * comparison with Mathematica: avoid misspelling variables through forced declaration (check that you can't do it in Mathematica).
% * evaluate=False vs HoldForm

Unevaluated expressions can be achieved in various ways,
most commonly with the \texttt{HoldForm} or \texttt{Hold} nodes,
that block the evaluation of subnodes by the parser.
Note that such a node cannot be expressed in Python, because of greedy evaluation.
Whenever needed in SymPy, it is necessary to add the parameter \texttt{evaluate=False}
to all subnodes, or put the input expression in a string.

% * comparison with Mathematica: == is structural equality, not

The operator == returns a boolean whenever it is able to immediately evaluate
the truthness of the equality, otherwise it returns an \texttt{Equal} expression.
In SymPy == means structural equality and is always guaranteed to return a
boolean expression.
To express an equality in SymPy it is necessary to explicitly construct the
\texttt{Equality} class.

% * comparison with Mathematica: polynomial module.
% * comparison with Mathematica: space is product, ** vs ^

SymPy, in accordance with Python and unlike the usual programming convention,
uses ** to express the power operator, while Mathematica uses the more
common \verb|^|.

% * comparison with Mathematica: ( ) is Sequence, functions are generally uppercase.
% * comparsion with Mathematica: table of comparison?
% * comparison with Mathematica: Wolfram language has loads of operator overloading, functional paradigm.
