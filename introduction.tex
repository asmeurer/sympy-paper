SymPy is a full featured computer algebra system (CAS) written in the Python
programming language. It is open source, licensed under the extremely
permissive 3-clause BSD license, which allows anyone to reuse SymPy or its source code,
even for commercial purposes. SymPy was started by Ond\v{r}ej \v{C}ert\'{\i}k
in 2005, and it has since grown into a large open source project, with over
500 contributors.

which is also the language used to interact with it, both programmatically and
interactively. Python is a popular dynamically typed programming language that
has a focus on ease of use and readability. Unlike many CASs, SymPy does not
invent its own programming language. We rather take the approach that Python
is already a well-designed programming language, built by expert language
designers, something which the majority of SymPy developers are not. Python is
also a very popular language for scientific computing and data science, with a
wide range of useful libraries.

SymPy is designed with a strong focus that it be usable as a library. This
means that extensibility is important in its API design. This is also one of
the reasons SymPy makes no attempt to extend the Python language itself. The
goal is for users of SymPy to be able to import SymPy alongside other Python
libraries in their workflow, whether that is an interactive workflow or
programmatic use as part of a larger library. This does have some downsides;
for instance, unlike many popular CASs, all variables in SymPy must be defined
before they are used (Python does not provide a mechanism to automatically
declare variables). This is a minor inconvenience for interactive use, but we
consider it to be good practice for any reproducible work, and it aligns with
the philosophy of Python, ``explicit is better than implicit.''

SymPy does not have a built in graphical user interface (GUI), however, when
